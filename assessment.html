            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="A"> Tell them to work harder and push through the burnout.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="B"> Ignore the issue and focus on meeting deadlines.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q6" value="C"> Encourage them to take a break and prioritize their well-being.<br><br>

            <h3>7. What is the difference between a decision tree and a random forest?</h3>
            <input type="radio" name="q7" value="A"> A decision tree is used for regression tasks, while a random forest is used for classification tasks.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q7" value="B"> A decision tree is more accurate than a random forest.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q7" value="C"> A decision tree is a single tree, while a random forest is an ensemble of multiple trees.<br><br>

            <h3>8. You are working on a project with a team. How do you handle conflicts?</h3>
            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="A"> Avoid conflicts by not communicating with team members.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="B"> Address the conflict directly and try to resolve it through open communication.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q8" value="C"> Let the team lead handle the conflict.<br><br>

            <h3>9. What is the purpose of a recurrent neural network (RNN) in natural language processing?</h3>
            <input type="radio" name="q9" value="A"> To classify text into different categories.<br>
            <input type="radio" name="q9" value="B"> To generate new text based on existing text.<br>
